# FeedBot

**AI based Feedback Portal System**  


Some protocols to follow:  
 1. While naming the file:  
 \* No spacing, Use underscore  
 \* Naming convention - "file_name_\(developer\_name\)" For example: chatbot\_architecture\(darshan\).jpg  
 2. Every file will be present in the respective milestone folder. 3. There will be a folder named "Original files" in each milestone. That folder will contain files, used for developement purposes.

  
 Status: **Designing the system**
