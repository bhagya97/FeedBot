# FeedBot
<b>AI based Feedback Portal System</b><br>

Some protocols to follow:<br>
1. While naming the file:<br>
    <t>* No spacing, Use underscore</t>
    <t>* Naming convention - "file_name_(developer_name)"   For example: chatbot_architecture(darshan).jpg </t><br>
2. Every file will be present in the respective milestone folder.
3. There will be a folder named "Original files" in each milestone. That folder will contain files, used for developement purposes.
