**AI based Feedback Portal System**

<h2>* Future works:<br></h2>
<h3>1. Create better and rigid database<br>
    2. Better Visualization (still lot of room for improvements)<br>
    3. Creating efficient NLP model (could not give enough time to this, and is of high essence.)<br>
    4.Much better analytics (lot of improvements can be done)<br>
    5. Better UI<br>
    6. Better Chatbot Engine (Currently it is a simple chatbot with static functionality which can be made dynamic and highly functional.)<br><br>
    <b> The project contains lot of technologies, implementing which takes time. Due to some unwanted situations and less time, we could not implement all the planned functionalities. Although we have created a prototype which can give an idea about the solution we are aiming for.</b><br>

 This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
